# AllDayJava, introduction to iOS accessibility

This basi application is only used as a short and obvious demo for
some concepts about iOS accessibility.

You will find the 3 following branches:

- `feature/basic_ui`
  Raw UI without any specific care for accessibility.
- `feature/accessibility`
  Some minor changes to add accessibility.
- `feature/ui-tests`
  Fast example to show how you can build on top on accessibility to test your application UI.
